    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Whisk ingredients together in a small bowl.</li>
        
        <li>Pour into a microwave safe mug.</li>
        
        <li>Microwave for about 60-75 seconds. It will expand pretty high so look out!</li>

        <li>Let cool for several minutes and then eat it straight from the mug if you like! And extra dollop of nutella on top is always amazing as well.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>All microwaves are different so the you may need to cook yours a touch longer or not as long.</strong> I keep a pretty good eye on mine and you can tell when it's about ready because the cake will rise and it will not look wet any longer.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a microwave safe mug with sides that go straight up.</strong> You want the Nutella mug cake to expand up and cook evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Start cook time at one minute.</strong> If a toothpick doesn't come up mostly clean, you can add another 15 or even 20 seconds.</li>
    <li><strong>Sweeten to your own taste.</strong> Since Nutella and most chocolate hazelnut spreads are already sweetened, you won't actually need too much but a little still is really nice to round out this rich treat in my opinion. IT will cut some of the bitterness from the cocoa powder for sure.</li>
    </ul>
